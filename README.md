###Introduction
This goal of this project is to clean, summarize and reshape the input data set into a tidy data set in order to be used for later analysis. 

* Input data: data generated by Anguita et al [1] from Samsung Galaxy SII during activity experiments on 30 volunteers doing 6 types of activities. more details is available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones. <br />
The data of this project can be downloaded from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip <br />
