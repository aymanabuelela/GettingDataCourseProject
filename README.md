###Introduction
The goal of this project is to clean, summarize and reshape the input data into a tidy data set in order to be used for later analysis. 

* Input data: data generated by Anguita et al [1] from Samsung Galaxy SII during activity experiments on 30 volunteers doing 6 types of activities. Details abouts the recorded features can be found in `CodeBook.md`. More details about the project is available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones. For any inquires about the original dataset contact: activityrecognition@smartlab.ws. For any inquireies about the modified data set contact: ayman.elkhodiery@kaust.edu.sa<br />
The data of this project can be downloaded from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. 
The input data are spplied in the "UCI HAR Dataset" directory. features list are in `feature.txt` and their description in `feature_info.txt`. Data are divided into 'train' and 'test' sets. Each set has 3 text files; X text file for the recorded feature signals, y text file for the activity labels and subject text file for the subject identifiers. The first feature in `feature.txt` correspond to the first column in the X text file e.g. `X_test.txt` and so on.

* Processing: The script `run_analysis.R` does the following to the input data.<br />
    1. modify feature names to comply with R naming guidelines by replacing '-' with '.' and removing '()'.
    2. 

* The output:

###The Repository contain the following files:
* `README.md`
* `run_analysis.R`: R script that cleans, summarizes and reshapes the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset"
* `CodeBook.md`: information about the variables used in the output file `tidy_`
